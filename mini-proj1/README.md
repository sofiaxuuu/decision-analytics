# Comparing Income in Baltimore, MD and New York with Opportunity Atlas Data

## Background
“Social mobility is the movement of individuals, families, households, or other categories of people within or between social strata in a society. It is a change in social status relative to one's current social location within a given society.” Keeping fluid social mobility is critical for the growth of cities, states, or countries. It gives hope for the poor to escape poverty and increases their living standards. It represents how resources are not controlled by a small group of people and is provided to improve the general standard of living. 

In particular, I want to dive into the social mobility for two cities: Baltimore and New York. I choose these two cities because I attend university in Baltimore, and have visited New York most of the time (as an international student). And I choose to assess social mobility by looking at the individual average income. 

## Business Question

## Data Question
1. How does the Individual Income level differ for U.S. Native and Immigrants in Baltimore and New York?

![Figure 1: Average Individual Income for Immigrants and U.S. Natives in Baltimore](https://github.com/sophiaxuu/decision-analytics/blob/main/mini-proj1/figures/Figure1.png)
![Figure 2: Average Individual Income for Immigrants and U.S. Natives in New York](https://github.com/sophiaxuu/decision-analytics/blob/main/mini-proj1/figures/Figure2.png)

By observing Figure1 and Figure2, we can find out that the Average Individual Income for Immigrants for both Baltimore and New York are approximately the same, which is about $31,500. And the Average of Individual Income for U.S. Native for both Baltimore and New York are also approximately the same, which is around $30,000. The finding is a bit surprise for me because previously I would assume immigrants will have a lower level of average income than natives. Some possible reasons maybe there is a higher population of U.S. natives are in the lowest income range, which could potentially drive the average down.
